Curious about me? Here you have it:
 I am a passionate, <u>self-proclaimed designer</u> who specializes in full stack development React.js & Node.js. I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.                                                                                   
I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I have continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development journey, I am building cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
 
I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development. 
    
When I am not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying some free time.
