                I am a passionate, <u>self-proclaimed designer</u> who
                specializes in full stack development React.js & Node.js. I am
                very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual
                aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel
                perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant

                I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I
                have continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new
                challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.
                Now, in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web
                development journey, I am building cutting-edge web applications
                using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript, Nestjs,
                Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.
